# TODO

- [ ] Calculate the NMSE, and calc corr coeff and p-value to get significance
- [ ] Read about Effect size and how to report it alongside p-value for a more scientifically accurate evaluation - [CHECK THIS](https://www.simplypsychology.org/effect-size.html)
- [ ] For the different cities, convert the raw data from IST to UTC using the same function used for Delhi observation met_data.
- [ ] Read and possibly implement low freq. and high freq. Variability.
- [ ] Plot of boxplots
